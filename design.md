# Design Notes

## Architecture Overview

### Triton (Engine Itself, static lib, `tr`)

#### Context `tr::ctx`

- Contains GameplaySystem and Renderer
- Handles decoupling the two so that renderer can be the only place where the graphics api is directly used.

#### Gameplay `tr::ctx::gp`

- Contain the ECS
- Provides GameplayAPI

#### Renderer `tr::ctx::gfx`

- Handles rendering and resource creation/management
- is completely unaware of which platform it's running on, and which windowing system has been used. The applications should be responsible for abstracting that away

### Editor (executable `tr::ed`

- Contains Imgui that can be handed to the renderer to be drawn
- Wires up window events, input callbacks etc into the context
- Wires up events Imgui needs
- Bridges Imgui components' inputs into the GameplayAPI
- Knows how to query the GamplayAPI in order to store game file(s)
- Knows how to read in game file(s) and set up the game using the GamplayAPI

### Game (executable `tr::gm`)

- Wires up things like window events, input callbacks, etc into the context.
- Reads optimized game files.
- Knows how to call the GameplayAPI with game file(s) information to set up and start the game.

## Component Detail

### Context

- News up a GameplaySystem and a Renderer, mediates communication between the two so they can stay decoupled.
- Recieves some sort of abstracted native window handle to be passed into the renderer's ctor so it knows where to render its output. (Vulkan will cast this to a GLFWwindow* in order to create the vk::Surface).
- Provides clients with a way to register application level callbacks and route them to the systems that need them.
- Provides clients access to the GameplayAPI.

### Gameplay API

Implemented as GameplayFacade class.

This API will sit on top of the ECS and essentially be an abstraction layer over it (like I didn't want to do).  This API will be available to the scripts attached to entities.  It will also be directly usable via the Editor's components as well.

API Needs:

- set state on a given entity (including adding/removing script components)
- query state of other entities
- create entities
- destroy entities
- create/read/update context data

Are these all anything will need to make a game? There may be certain things that make sense to build into the engine, terrain generation/paging, day night cycle for example.
