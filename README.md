# Triton

Triton is the latest of a 3D game framework that I have been writing off and on with various different technologies
in some form or another for the better part of 20 years now.  The current implementation attempts to use as 
'modern' of C++ as is possible and uses Vulkan for the graphics rendering.

At present there is not much to see here as I'm still working through Vulkan's exceedingly verbose initialization
process.

## Roadmap

- set up vulkan's debug layers with naming for all objects
- draw a triangle
- load models
- draw a bunch of models
- draw a bunch of models with different renderpasses and pipelines
- add profiling
- draw a bunch of models effectively
- create an actual game
